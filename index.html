        <p><span data-actor="Vader">Vader: You are beaten. It is useless
                                            to resist. Don’t let yourself
                                            be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.</span></p>

      <p>Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so
        viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder</p>

      <p><span data-actor="Vader">Vader: There is no escape. Don’t make
                                            me destroy you. You do not yet
                                            realize your importance. You
                                            have only begun to discover your
                                            power. Join me and I will complete
                                            your training. With our combined
                                            strength, we can end this destructive
                                            conflict and bring order to the
                                            galaxy.</span></p>
       
      <p><span data-actor="Luke">Luke: I’ll never join you!</span></p>

      <p><span data-actor="Vader">Vader: If you only knew the power of the
                                            dark side. Obi-Wan never told
                                            you what happened to your father.</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="Luke">Luke: He told me enough! It was you
                                        who killed him.</span></p>
      <p><span data-actor="Vader">Vader: No. I am your father.</span></p>
